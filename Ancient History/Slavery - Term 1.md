# Slavery in the ancient world 
---

Main Points:
- Understand origins of slavery and the position of slaves and masters 
- Discuss the dis-empowerment of slaves 

Slavery was extensive in the ancient world, almost every great empire used slavery
- Slaves may have amounted to one third of the population in these areas but little exact information. 
- Slaves worked in mining and agriculture as well as domestic service, cleaning and cooking for their masters 
- Slavery was also considered normal in ancient societies 


Definition of slavery:
One human being is legally the property of another can be bought or sold, is not allowed to escape and must work of the owner without any choice involved. 


The quote is relevant in appreciation the powerless position of slaves because it is directly informing people of the conditions that the slaves work in. This is seen with the quote directly stating "They can be bought, sold, disciplined and disposed of." This further supports that slaves are treated as property and have little to no rights over their every actions, even after death with the master being able to dispose of the bodies ignoring the wishes of their family or themselves. 


Because of harsh treatments, revolts were common

## Slavery in Babylon 
Slave responsibilities were to cater to the masters needs
Masters were expected to feed, water and proved shelter for the slaves. 

These laws perpetrate the dis-empowerment of slaves because they actively encourage people to return slaves and punish people for trying to free the slaves.

## Slaves from war
## Source 2 
-> this source explicitly states that he took captains and chieftans and branded them and thier families, making them slaves 

## Source 3 & Source 4 
Thte sources corroborate each other because they both state the people were taken and made into slaves. In Source 3 it states that the Captains of the Archers, presumably a military division of archers, and the chief men of the tribes of the defeated, with source 4 corroborating htis becuase it explicetly states that prisoners of war and tribiute were taken by the victors and probably made into slaves.   

## Egyptian Slavery 

There were two types of slaves, Domestic Slaves and Foreign Slaves,
Domestic slaves were Egyptian and were generally people who intentionally sold themselves into slavery and treated well by their owners, while foreign slaves were people who were captured in war and sold by Merchants.

Children of slaves were passed on together with their parents 

Egyptian believed that in the afterlife, your decisions, good and bad, affected how you were affected in the afterlife, leading to some to avoid abusing their slaves
