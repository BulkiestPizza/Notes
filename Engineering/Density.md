# Density
---
 

The equation for density is p = m/V

p is the greek letter rho 

Convert units to kg and M when working with density 

## Scientific Notation Questions
1.
	a.
		i. $8.9*10^7$
		ii. $1.1*10^10$

## Density Questions

1.  p = m/V
	p = 306/0.3
	p = 1020km/m^3
2. p = m/V
    1000 = m/0.5
     500kg = m
3. p = m/V
    8050 = m/0.2
    1610kg = m
4. p = m/V
    8050 = m/0.2

## Cylinder Questions
V = $(pi*8^2)*75$ 
V = $64pi*75$
V = $4800mm^3pi$

V = $0.0048m^3*pi$

p = $m/V$
p = $0.1/0.0048pi$
p = 0.001507
