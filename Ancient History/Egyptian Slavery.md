# Egyptian Slavery
---


There were two types of slaves, Domestic Slaves and Foreign Slaves,
Domestic slaves were Egyptian and were generally people who intentionally sold themselves into slavery and treated well by their owners, while foreign slaves were people who were captured in war and sold by Merchants.

Children of slaves were passed on together with their parents 

Egyptian believed that in the afterlife, your decisions, good and bad, affected how you were affected in the afterlife, leading to some to avoid abusing their slaves 

Certain virtues were to be recited in the afterlife, for example, "I have not domineered over slaves, I have not vilified a slave to his master."

The writer wrote the source because they need more men to plough the fields to grow food. 


Slavery in Ancient Egypt is drastically better for the slaves than in many other societies. This is becuase slaves were generally treated very well in comparison because of the egyptian belief that harming people, and slaves, would not allow you to dine with the gods. This is seen in source 2 "I am your servant...You will protect me, you will keep me safe, you will guard me..."(Peter Piccione, *The status of Women in Ancient Egyptian Society*) This quote proves that people are willing to be slaves, showing that they were treated quite well, and it wasn't looked down upon to be a slave. 

## Questions 
1. Who were Slaves
	1. Source 4 Describes the possesions of the house as 'Servants' potentially indicating that the slaves had general duties around the house
2. Source 3 describes POWs branded and made into slaves potentially indicating that they can be forced into slavery 
3. Source 7 describes that the slaves can become freed by visiting a temple and giving himself to the gods. 


Slaves in Ancient Egypt could be obtained by various different ways. They can be obtained through a persons will, as an inheritance, or could willingly give themselves up to slavery. This is seen in Source 2 "I am your servant, together with my children and my children's children. I shall not be free in your precinct forever and ever." This source describes a woman willingly giving herself up to a master of an estate, showing that slaves intentionally chose to become slaves. Another way someone might procure a slave is through someones will. This is seen in Source 4 "I bequeath to the Citizenesss Ineksenedjem, the woman who is in my house, all that I have acquired with her, namely, two male servants and two female servants." This shows that someone has given their spouse their slaves, showing that slaves can be passed down like property. In conclusion slaves can be procured  in a variety of ways, including someones will and the slave giving themselves up  to slavery. 

Slaves in Ancient egypt could be freed in many different ways. Slaves could be freed by travelling to a temple and giving themselves up to the service of the gods. this is exemplified in Source 7 " ...a temple of Heracles, in which any man's slave take refuge and have the sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god. It is not lawful to lay hands on him" This source shows that slaves who went to the temple could be freed if he gave themselves up to a life of servitude to a different master. Another way that slaves could be freed is by being bought out of slavery. which is seen in source 8 "...she was redeemed from slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene...thus Rhodopis was set free." This source proves that slaves could be bought, but is was probably very rare as it was described as 'a great sum', potentially unaffordable for most of the Egyptian working class. In conclusion slaves being freed was far more common than that of recent history, it was still rather hard to obtain your freedom as a slave.
