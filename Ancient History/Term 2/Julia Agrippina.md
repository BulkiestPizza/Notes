### Sources by tacitus
Explicit
-> "The first death under the new priincipate, that of Junius Silanus"
-> Junius was "proconsul of Asia"
-> he was killed without "Nero's congnizance "
-> Tacitus explicitly states that he was killed "by treachery on the part of Agrippina"
-> Sates that Agrippina "Procured the death of his brother Lucius Silanus"
-> States that she killed Junius becasue she "feared him as a pooible avenger" of his brother Lucius

The source also states that "it was a generally expressed opinion of the multitude [population]that Nero, barely emerged from boyhood" should not be the ruler
