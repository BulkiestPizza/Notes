---
Also known as Agrippina the younger, or the mother of Nero 

She is the great granddaughter of Augustus

Her mother Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of Julia (Ceasars daughter) and Grand Daughter of Augustus, she was very protective of her elevated imperial status 

Agreppina the younger was one of the most powerful and influential women of Rome 
She used her strong family ties and the relationships she had with the men in her life 
She plotted against with her brother the Emperor Caligula who who allegedly slept with her and her sisters 
- She murdered her husband and uncle Claudius
- She Controlled her sone Nero by sleeping with him, allegedly

### Sources describing her could be biased against her
- She was by far the most influential women in Rome, and in such a Patriarchal society it would have been looked down upon to have a woman in this position 


### Sources by Tacitus
Explicit
-> "The first death under the new principate, that of Junius Silanus"
-> Junius was "proconsul of Asia"
-> he was killed without "Nero's cognisance "
-> Tacitus explicitly states that he was killed "by treachery on the part of Agrippina"
-> Sates that Agrippina "Procured the death of his brother Lucius Silanus"
-> States that she killed Junius because she "feared him as a possible avenger" of his brother Lucius

The source also states that "it was a generally expressed opinion of the multitude [population]that Nero, barely emerged from boyhood" should not be the ruler 

Implicit 
1. Agrippina killed Junius Silanus under Nero's reign 
2. Nero Was unaware of his mothers power grabs, potentially hinting that she wants to overthrow him.
3. Agrippina was paranoid and tactical because of the murder of Lucius Silanus
