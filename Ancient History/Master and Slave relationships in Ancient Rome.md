# Master and Slave relationships in Ancient Rome
---


- Understand the relationship between master and slave and how that contributed to slave revolts 

Diodorus Siculus 
-> Masters were very strict and severe 
-> Slaves forced to steal because masters didn't give them enough food
-> They were vilely beaten and scourged  
-> when slaves could meet they formed plans to push back and revolt against their masters 

Plutarch - Life of Crassus
-> most of Batiatus's slaves were Gauls and Thracians
-> Slaves elected leaders 
-> Lentulus Batiatus was a cruel owner 
-> Slaves were kept in close quarters 

1. Masters didn't value their slaves. The slaves also had no respect for their masters.
2. The relationship between the masters and their slaves is quite volatile, leading to rebellion
3. Potentially cheaper to not feed their slaves, feel of control over others.
4. Slaves valued their freedom, motivating them to revolt
