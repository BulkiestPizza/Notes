---

LI: To understand how to calculate population densities 
SC: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
-	Calculate the population density of countries 

## What is population density 
Population density is a figure that describes how many people live in a specific region. In general, it provides us with the average amount of people living per square kilometre in a region or country 

 $$Formula$$
$$P/A$$ 
For example: 
$$36,000,000/9,984,670$$
$$=3.61/km^2$$

Therefore Canada's population density is $3.61km^2$

Australia: 25,704,340
Bangladesh: 166,938,851
Brazil: 214,631,543
China, 1,411,778,724
Nigeria: 213,117,109
