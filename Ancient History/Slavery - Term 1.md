# Slavery in the ancient world 
---

Main Points:
- Understand origins of slavery and the position of slaves and masters 
- Discuss the dis-empowerment of slaves 

Slavery was extensive in the ancient world, almost every great empire used slavery
- Slaves may have amounted to one third of the population in these areas but little exact information. 
- Slaves worked in mining and agriculture as well as domestic service, cleaning and cooking for their masters 
- Slavery was also considered normal in ancient societies 


Definition of slavery:
One human being is legally the property of another can be bought or sold, is not allowed to escape and must work of the owner without any choice involved. 


The quote is relevant in appreciation the powerless position of slaves because it is directly informing people of the conditions that the slaves work in. This is seen with the quote directly stating "They can be bought, sold, disciplined and disposed of." This further supports that slaves are treated as property and have little to no rights over their every actions, even after death with the master being able to dispose of the bodies ignoring the wishes of their family or themselves. 


Because of harsh treatments, revolts were common

## Slavery in Babylon 
Slave responsibilities were to cater to the masters needs
Masters were expected to feed, water and proved shelter for the slaves. 

These laws perpetrate the dis-empowerment of slaves because they actively encourage people to return slaves and punish people for trying to free the slaves. This is explained in the laws as one states that if a barber is to attempt to free the slave they have their hands cut off, and another states that if runaway slaves are found, by anyone, they should be returned for profit and if a slave tries to rebel the master is fully within his rights to cut off his ears.

## Hammurabi Code Teeel
The Hammurabi code perpetrates the disempowertment of slaves because 


## Slavery in Ancient Egypt 
 LI: Analyse sources from ancient Egypt to evaluate the use of slavery in their everyday lives

Hem (Hm) generally traslated to 'slave'

Source 1

-> The house had either had the food and house looted and taken, or he is poor. 
-> Their father passed away 

## Slaves from war
## Source 2 
-> this source explicitly states that he took captains and chieftans and branded them and thier families, making them slaves 

## Source 3 & Source 4 
Thte sources corroborate each other because they both state the people were taken and made into slaves. In Source 3 it states that the Captains of the Archers, presumably a military division of archers, and the chief men of the tribes of the defeated, with source 4 corroborating htis becuase it explicetly states that prisoners of war and tribiute were taken by the victors and probably made into slaves.   

## Egyptian Slavery 

There were two types of slaves, Domestic Slaves and Foreign Slaves,
Domestic slaves were Egyptian and were generally people who intentionally sold themselves into slavery and treated well by their owners, while foreign slaves were people who were captured in war and sold by Merchants.

Children of slaves were passed on together with their parents 

Egyptian believed that in the afterlife, your decisions, good and bad, affected how you were affected in the afterlife, leading to some to avoid abusing their slaves 

Certain virtues were to be recited in the afterlife, for example, "I have not domineered over slaves, I have not vilified a slave to his master."

## Source 8
Explicit Meanings:
- Two men escaped
- They were beated 
- They needed the slaves to plough the earth (grow food)
- The writer is not the lord 
Implicit
- The slaves escaped because of the beatings 
- They need slaves to grow food 
- The writer is presumably a scribe, or skilled slave

The writer wrote the source because they need more men to plough the fields to grow food. 


Slavery in Ancient Egypt is drastically better for the slaves than in many other societies. This is becuase slaves were generally treated very well in comparison because of the egyptian belief that harming people, and slaves, would not allow you to dine with the gods. This is seen in source 2 "I am your servant...You will protect me, you will keep me safe, you will guard me..."(Peter Piccione, *The status of Women in Ancient Egyptian Society*) This quote proves that people are willing to be slaves, showing that they were treated quite well, and it wasn't looked down upon to be a slave. 

## Questions 
1. Who were Slaves
	1. Source 4 Describes the possesions of the house as 'Servants' potentially indicating that the slaves had general duties around the house
2. Source 3 describes POWs branded and made into slaves potentially indicating that they can be forced into slavery 
3. Source 7 describes that the slaves can become freed by visiting a temple and giving himself to the gods. 


Slaves in Ancient Egypt could be obtained by various different ways. They can be obtained through a persons will, as an inheritance, or could willingly give themselves up to slavery. This is seen in Source 2 "I am your servant, together with my children and my children's children. I shall not be free in your precinct forever and ever." This source describes a woman willingly giving herself up to a master of an estate, showing that slaves intentionally chose to become slaves. Another way someone might procure a slave is through someones will. This is seen in Source 4 "I bequeath to the Citizenesss Ineksenedjem, the woman who is in my house, all that I have acquired with her, namely, two male servants and two female servants." This shows that someone has given their spouse their slaves, showing that slaves can be passed down like property. In conclusion slaves can be procured  in a variety of ways, including someones will and the slave giving themselves up to slavery. 

Slaves in Ancient egypt could be freed in many different ways. Slaves could be freed by travelling to a temple and giving themselves up to the service of the gods. this is exemplified in Source 7 " ...a temple of Heracles, in which any man's slave take refuge and have the sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god. It is not lawful to lay hands on him" This source shows that slaves who went to the temple could be freed if he gave themselves up to a life of servitude to the gods
