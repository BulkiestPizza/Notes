# Spartan Slaves

## Slaves in Sparta
- Depended on the Helots for agricultural production 
- They were initailly Laconians that were defeated and Conquered. They were fellow Greeks. This was not seen favourably by the other Greek city states. The enslaved Messenians formed the bulk of the helots 
- Helots were owned by the state. They livedin the household of their master but unlike ordinary slaves, their master could not declare them free. They worked as domestic, agricultural and military servants
- It was documented that helots were forced to consume alcohol so that their drunken behaviour could be observed by Spartans 
- They could not be freed

### Helot Rights 
- They were state owned serfs and were protected by the state, which relied heavily on them for their survival, therefore to kill or injure a Helot was a serious crime
