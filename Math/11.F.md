1. a $(8*3)$ x $(2*3)$
$24$ x $6$
b. $r = 5*2$
$r = 10$
c. $1.25$ X $1.25$ + $2$   

2. 
   a i,iii
   b. i, ii Because they are only different by exactly double 
   c. i, ii " " " " " " " 
   d. i, iii " " " " " " "
   e. i, iii THey are very close measurements 

3. a. CDE ||| ACB  
   b. ABC ||| PQR 
   c. PQR ||| SRT 
   d. ABC ||| CDE 
   e. ABD ||| ADC 

4. ABC is similar to CDE 
5. 3:6 as 1:2 
   4*2 = 8 
   therefore CDE is similar to ABC by a scale factor of 2 
   b. <A is the same on both 
   ii. D is corresponding to B 
   iii. E is corresponding to A 
   Therefore ABC ||| to CED beacsue they all have the same angle 

   c. ACE is Diveided between the two shapes 
   ii. <B = D
   iii. they share right angles 
   
   d. C is shared 
   ii. A is corresponding to E 
   iii. B is corresponding to D 


6.  a. AB = 1.5 
      RS = 1.5*2
   b. the scale factor is 2 
7. BC=DE, AE equal to AD 
   
   b. DE = 6
      CE = 8 
 8. 
   a. 3/2=5/h
      3h=10 
      h=10/3
      h=3.33

      i= 3/5=2/i 
      i=3i=10
      i= 10/3
      i=3.33
   b. 
      8.33/3 = 5/j
      8.33j = 15
      j = 15/8.33
      j = 1.801

      k. 3/6.801=2/k
         3k=13.602
         k= 13.602/3
         k = 4.534
