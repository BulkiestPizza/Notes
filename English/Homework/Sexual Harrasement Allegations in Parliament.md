Reynolds was pressured to stand down by Labor Senator Kristina Keneally saying "Is the Minister of defence, Linda Reynolds, trying to pretend she is (on one hand) well enough to continue as Defence Minister, but not well enough on the other to front up and answer to questions in parliament and the (Senate) estimates?" Because of her actions in the allegations by Higgins, she also called for another investigation against Christian Porter.
