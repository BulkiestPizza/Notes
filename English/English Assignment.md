Dystopian fiction is a reflection of society, and is often a product of the time that it was written. They have developed from depressing statements about horrible futures with no hope for change into modern dystopian fiction which allows the development of the society and portray its ability to change, in a more natural development.  The dystopian fiction being discussed is one film and one text. *The Hunger Games* released in 2012 and was directed by Gary Ross, and *Harrison Bergeron*, written by Kurt Vonnegut in 1961. Through the use of characterisation both of the selected media have explored acts of rebellion and conflict. They both position the reader to perceive the rebellious acts against the current government, or society, as positive things. However, they both explore the impacts of rebellious actions and how they can be misconstrued by a government, or poor rebellious icons in order to turn people against them. Both of the sources of media being discussed have used characterisation and symbolism, along with various other aesthetic features to convey their points of view, Vonnegut has tried to convince people that Harrison's rebellion was doomed to fail because of his selfish nature, and Ross has shown the impact that the Capitol has on its citizens and how Katniss has unknowingly caused a disaster with her actions. z

The text *Harrison Bergeron*, by Kurt Vonnegut, uses the character of Harrison and his symbolism to display acts of rebellion, and how he characterises Harrison in order to explain that Harrison's actions and beliefs causes his rebellion to fail. Harrison represents everything that the government has convinced the population that un-handicapped are. He is both a genius and an athlete, however, because he is both selfish and power hungry Vonnegut caused him to fail, because he is trying to portray that not all rebellions are lead by good intentions. Kurt Vonnegut portrays this in this passage "He stamped his foot and the studio shook" (Kurt Vonnegut, 1961) Vonnegut uses this immature action to exemplify Harrison's character, as it represents him in a similar vein to the Greek gods, widely portrayed as overgrown, very powerful children. Vonnegut's use of characterisation and symbolism positions the audience to view Harrison as unfit to rule and could potentially be even worse than the current government. Vonnegut is potentially alluding to the Russian Revolution, which overthrew the government and replaced it with a communist dictatorship, which assists Vonnegut's beliefs that rebellions are negative occurrences and cause more suffering than the previous government that they overthrew. The use of characterisation and symbolism to enforce Vonnegut's negative views on rebellion.

In the film the Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, the character of Katniss Everdeen is used as a symbol for the oppression of the Capitol and as a rebellious icon. 
 Katniss is used as a rebellious icon and her character is a symbol of independence and defiance because of her acts in even the very early scenes of the movie, and while in this movie no outright rebellion is seen, unlike the later films, she still has many minor rebellions that infuriate the Capitol. She represents the desire of people to make their own decisions and be prosperous, in sharp contrast to Harrison, who mainly represents Neutral-Negative emotions such as pride. Gary Ross has used the scene of Rue's death to position the audience to view Katniss in a positive light, with her covering her body in flowers and sending her off with a three finger salute. The flowers are used to symbolise youth and innocence, and how cruel the Hunger Games are to the citizens of the Districts, and the three finger salute shows her respect towards her family and friends, and unfortunately leads into a brutal massacre because of a riot started, incidentally, by Katniss. The use of characterisation and symbolism reinforces Gary Ross's negative views on rebellion, but unlike Vonnegut he portrays the government the cause of the suffering, instead of the rebellious people themselves.

 Conclusion

Through the use of Characterisation and symbolism both Kurt Vonnegut and Gary Ross have portrayed the themes of rebellion and conflict in not necessarily positive lights, with Vonnegut portraying Harrison rather Negatively, with him not being exactly a paragon hero. On the other hand Ross has portrayed Katniss extremely positively and being seen as a symbol of great things to come. The dystopian aspect of commenting on our society is very good at exposing the issues widely present in the society in a more digestible way, and allows people to determine what should be done to avert the course of history.
