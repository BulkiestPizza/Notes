## Context Sentence 

Dystopian fiction is a staple of modern writing, they are often designed to reflect problems and issues present in our society and extend them to the absolute worst case scenario. It has been exploding in recent years, it was originally inspired by the tensions of WW2 and the cold war that followed by commenting of the governments of the time, namely the USSR in Russia and the Nazi party in Germany, and they originally had no heroes and the world didn't usually change but modern dystopia's have allowed the development of heroes the world can improve and change.

## Topic Sentence 
The text Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut uses the character of Harrison and his symbolism to display acts of rebellion and the effect that they can have on society, and they aren't entirely positive.


## Elaboration
Harrison displays everything that the society in the story is against, with him being a genius and extremely strong in a society that is actively trying to hamper development of individuality. He represents the inert desires of people's egos and their desires to be remembered after death. He may have clear symbolism but his character is what makes it work, with him being a petulant child who believes that he is the greatest man to ever live, showing what many peoples desires to rebel, even if they are not aware that they want to because of the oppressive control that the government has on their minds. 


## Evidence
Kurt Vonnegut uses this quote in Harrisons opening speech "He stamped his foot and the studio shook" 

## Explanation
The use of the immature action of stamping his foot like a child proves his character is prone to emotional instability and that it can easily be a stand in for the desperation of the human mind when subjected under unknown circumstances. The book also goes out of its way to show that Harrison's rebellion was practically pointless and didn't inspire change in the way that the country functions. This is because the people perceive the handicaps as good things, meant to make society better, instead his act of rebellion has made the society worse because it can be inferred from the conversations with George and Hazel that george believes that the handicaps are only fair, because without them society would be chaos, and the rebellion of Harrison has proved in the eyes of the public that un-handicapped people are dangerous and cannot be trusted.

## Linking
In the text Kurt Vonnegut has used a variety of features with his use of symbolism and characterisation in order to show the rebellious acts effects on society and how they can be potentially misconstrued into helping the thing that they were rebelling against.

## Topic Sentence 

In the film The Hunger Games ,directed by Gary Ross, the main character, Katniss Everdeen, through her characterisation is used as a symbol for the oppression of the Capitol and as a rebellious icon.

## Elaboration 
Katniss is used as a rebellious icon and her character is a symbol of independence and defiance because of her acts in even the very early scenes of the movie, and while in this movie no outright rebellion is seen, unlike the later films, she still has many minor rebellions that infuriate the Capitol. She represents the desire of people to make their own decisions and be prosperous, in sharp contrast to Harrison, who mainly represents Neutral-Negative emotions such as pride.

## Evidence 
Ross uses the scene of Rue's Death, which contains not a shred of dialogue but is impactful nonetheless, an excerpt from the book which this scene is based on reads "I decorate her body in the flowers, covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colours...She could really be asleep in that meadow after all."

## Explanation
This excerpt shows how sympathetic Ross makes Katniss with her being shown to covering her body in flowers, which makes all the more impact when in the film immediately after district 11 erupts into rebellion, using Katniss's two finger salute as a symbol for rebellion. This helps to symbolise Katniss as the symbol of the rebellion and helps prove her characteristics as being more sympathetic than that of Harrison with her showing kindness and selfless to someone, potentially risking her life by wasting time commemorating Rue, and at the same time causing an uproar in the Capitol because her actions have caused rebellion in the districts. 

## Linking Sentence 

The film the Hunger games portrays Katniss as a sympathetic icon and uses her to show that rebellions are forces for change and good in the world.

 Conclusion

***

Through the use of Characterisation and symbolism both Kurt Vonnegut and Gary Ross have portrayed the themes of rebellion and conflict in not necessarily positive lights, with Vonnegut portraying Harrison rather Negatively, with him not being exactly a paragon hero. On the other hand Ross has portrayed Katniss extremely positively and being seen as a symbol of great things to come. The dystopian aspect of commenting on our society is very good at exposing the issues widely present in the society in a more digestible way, and allows people to determine what should be done to avert the course of history.
