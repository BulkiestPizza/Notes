R&C 5/25 marks

Context
The Queensland Water alliance requires a new design for a water tower located in western Queensland

Aim 
The aim of this report is to design and construct a solution for the base of a water tower to ensure that the tower supports the mass of the required tower

Success Criteria
The water is position on level ground
12000L tank is 2.5 m in diameter
12 m high
No larger than 3 x 3 m
Prototype
Hold 40kg 
Use less than 10 lengths of 915*6*6
1:30 Balsa wood prototype needs to be drawn designed and constructed

- Research
- Engineering technology 
Triangles are good for distributing force when pushed on its points, making it good for designing objects under strain.
- Mechanics 
The tower needs to support high amounts of compressive and tensile forces in the individual braces, Cross braces will also need to be implemented to reduce the deflective forces.
- Materials
Water towers are required to be built of non-porous (materials that don’t let water through); They also require materials that don’t rust, often using steel and other metals.

However the task requires that the prototypes be built of balsa wood due to its portability and ability to manipulate. 
Balsa wood is also good due to it having a tensile strength of 1MPa
