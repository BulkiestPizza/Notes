# Data Types and Variables
---

Integer, "int", is used to represent decimal numbers and has two types, signed and unsigned signed is used for integers on the left and right of the decimal place, unsigned is used for integers only on the right 

Character, "char", is used to represent text, or characters 

Real, represents all numbers, whether decimal or integer, that are present on the number line, and is classified as either a float, double, and long double depending on the type 

Pointer, they are special data types that hold the address of the variable that they point to, '&' and '* are the two operators that are used when pointers are implemented. '&' gives the address of the variable, while * accesses the value at an address.

## User defined data in C 
Typedef, defines an identifier that can represent an existing data type, increasing the readability of code with greater complexity 

Enumerated, enum, creastes a data type that can be assigned a value from a specific set of values

## Derived data types in C 
Arrays, *Vartype* a[*No*], its an array not much to say

Structure, is a collection of non-homogeneous data types. it is very popular as it can store lots of properties of an element, it is similar to classes 

Union is the same as structure but handles memory differently by having the entire data set having the same location
