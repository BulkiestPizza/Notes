Dystopian fiction is a reflection of society, and is often a product of the time that it was written. They have developed from depressing statements about horrible governments with no hope for change into modern dystopias which allow the development of the society and portray its ability to change. They have become popular in modern society because it makes people think of interesting issues, but allows them to take a step back and view it through a fictional lens. The dystopian fiction being discussed is one film and one text. The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, and *Harrison Bergeron*, written by Kurt Vonnegut. Through the use of Characterisation both of the selected media have explored acts of rebellion and conflict. They both position the reader to percicve the rebellious acts against the current governemnt, or society, as positive things. However, they both explore the impaces of rebellious actions and how they can be misconstrued by a government, or poor rebellious icons in order to turn people against them. Both of the sources of media being discussed have used characterisation and symbolism, along with various other aesthetic features to convey their points of view, Kurt has tried to convice people that Harrisons rebelion was doomed to fail because of his selfish nature, and Ross has shown the impact that the Capitol has on its citizens and how Katniss has unkowningly caused a disaster with her actions.

The text *Harrison Bergeron*, by Kurt Vonnegut, uses the character of Harrison and his symbolism to display acts of rebellion, and how he characterises Harrison in order to explain that Harrisons actions and beliefs causes his rebellion to fail. Harrison represents everything that the governemnt has convinced the population that un-handicapped are. He is both a genius and an athlete, however, beacuse he is both selfish and power hungry Vonnegut casued him to fail, becasue he is trying to portray that not all rebellions are lead by good intentions. Kurt Vonnegut portrays this in this passage "He stamped his foot and the studio shook" Vonnegut uses this immature action to exemplify Harrison's character, as it represents him in a similar vein to the greek gods, widely portrayed as overgrown, very powerful children. Vonnegut's use of characterisation and symbolism positions the audience to view Harrison as unfit to rule and could potentially be even worse than the current governemnt. Vonnegut is potentially allluding to the Russian Revolution, which overthrew the government and replaced it with a communist dictatorship, which assists Vonnegut's beliefs that rebellions are negative occurences and cause more suffering than the previous government that they overthrew. The use of characterisation and symbolism to enforce Vonneguts negative views on rebellion.

## Topic Sentence 

In the film the Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, the character of Katniss Everdeen is used as a symbol for the opression of the Capitol and as a rebellious icon. 
 Katniss is used as a rebellious icon and her character is a symbol of independence and defiance because of her acts in even the very early scenes of the movie, and while in this movie no outright rebellion is seen, unlike the later films, she still has many minor rebellions that infuriate the Capitol. She represents the desire of people to make their own decisions and be prosperous, in sharp contrast to Harrison, who mainly represents Neutral-Negative emotions such as pride. Gary Ross has used the scene of Rue's death to posistion the audience to view Katniss in a positive light, with her covering her body in flowers and sending her off with a three finger salute. The flowers are used to symbolise youth and innocence, and how cruel the Hunger Games are to the citizens of the Districts, and the three finger salute shows her respect 

<!-- Ross uses the scene of Rue's Death, which contains not a shred of dialogue but is impactful nonetheless, an excerpt from the book which this scene is based on reads "I decorate her body in the flowers, covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colours...She could really be asleep in that meadow after all."//Book Evidence Bad // Use symbolism flowers and // what do the flowers represent // how does this position the audience to view katniss  -->

## Explanation
This excerpt shows how sympathetic Ross makes Katniss with her being shown to covering her body in flowers, which makes all the more impact when in the film immediately after district 11 erupts into rebellion, using Katniss's two finger salute as a symbol for rebellion. This helps to symbolise Katniss as the symbol of the rebellion and helps prove her characteristics as being more sympathetic than that of Harrison with her showing kindness and selfless to someone, potentially risking her life by wasting time commemorating Rue, and at the same time causing an uproar in the Capitol because her actions have caused rebellion in the districts. // Work on scentence structure 

## Linking Sentence 

The film the Hunger games portrays Katniss as a sympathetic icon and uses her to show that rebellions are forces for change and good in the world.

 Conclusion

Through the use of Characterisation and symbolism both Kurt Vonnegut and Gary Ross have portrayed the themes of rebellion and conflict in not necessarily positive lights, with Vonnegut portraying Harrison rather Negatively, with him not being exactly a paragon hero. On the other hand Ross has portrayed Katniss extremely positively and being seen as a symbol of great things to come. The dystopian aspect of commenting on our society is very good at exposing the issues widely present in the society in a more digestible way, and allows people to determine what should be done to avert the course of history.
