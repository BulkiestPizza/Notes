# Master and Slave relationships in Ancient Rome
---


- Understand the relationship between master and slave and how that contributed to slave revolts 

Diodorus Siculus 
-> Masters were very strict and severe 
-> Slaves forced to steal because masters didn't give them enough food
-> They were vilely beaten and scourged  
-> when slaves could meet they formed plans to push back and revolt against their masters 

Plutarch - Life of Crassus
