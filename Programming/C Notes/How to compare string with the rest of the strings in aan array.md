# How to compare string with the rest of the strings in an array
---


Loop through all of the names in the arrays? 
e.g 
have two for loops that increment and switch to the next item in the array than another loop that checks if the item is the same as an item in the next row, and then the next row e.t.c, because we dont need to check the same row because there are no duplicates.
loops until n = 8, and if n = 7 we do k++, unless k = total, breaking the loop, which should loop through every item in the array and compare it with the current one. 

then we check if the item in the array is equal to another item and set it to whitespace
